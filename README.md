Project Description: RNAseq Data Extraction from NCBI GEO using SRA Toolkit

In this project, I demonstrated my proficiency with bash commands on macOS 
to extract RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GEO) database using the SRA Toolkit. The primary goal was to efficiently 
retrieve and process RNAseq datasets for subsequent bioinformatics analyses.

Project Steps:

1. Installation and Configuration of SRA Toolkit:
   - Installed the SRA Toolkit on my macOS system.
   - Configured the toolkit using bash commands to ensure proper setup and access to necessary resources.

2. Data Retrieval:
   - Utilized the `fasterq-dump` command to download and extract RNAseq data from the GEO accession SRR15852393.
   - Applied the `--split-files` option to separate paired-end reads, facilitating more detailed downstream analyses.

3. Unix Shell Proficiency:
   - Navigated the filesystem and managed directories using `cd`, `ls`, and other basic unix shell commands.
   - Monitored the data extraction process and verified file integrity through shell-based checks.

Outcome:
This project not only underscored my ability to handle bioinformatics tools
and data but also showcased my competency in using bash commands on macOS to
perform complex data extraction tasks. The skills demonstrated here are fundamental
for bioinformatics research and data analysis workflows.
